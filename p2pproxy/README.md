code is really messy but after initial testing there was no need to continue

(test was performed concurrently with each other)

network -> p2pProxy -> factomd network = ~2.1mm msg/s
factomdnetwork -> p2pProxy -> network = ~1.6mm msg/s

tldr: fast enough that it's not useful to continue benchmarking at this point
